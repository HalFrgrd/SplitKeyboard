# SplitKeyboard
Files for my split keyboard

This is a split diy custom keyboard based on a TenKeyLess design of the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard.
Each half is controlled using an Arduino pro micro and can be used independently. When they are not used independently a TRS jack on each half is used to connect a TRRS cable. TRRS cable is used as I may replace the TRS jacks with TRRS jacks to allow for I2C communication as 4 wires are required (TipRingSleeve only has three).
